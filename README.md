# IanSavchenko.Controls

Controls lib for WP8.1. 

Main content - ListSelector which looks almost exactly as original DatePicker.

I was frustrated by abscence of so cool looking control as DatePicker or TimePicker for usage by other developers that decided to make my own. It looks pretty similar, but is not so super smooth as original and has no looping support (yet, who knows). 

Also, lib contains ListSelectorFlyout that should be used to show ListSelector in Flyout, because Flyout and PickerFlyoutBase have unlimited vertical scrolling.

I haven't published control as NuGet package yet, but if you need it, let me know.

Example of how control can be used.
